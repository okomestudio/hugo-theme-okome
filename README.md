# Hugo Theme

This is the Hugo theme used for okomestudio.net. It was forked from the [Blank
theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/blank/)


## Install

Here, *<hugo-base>* is the root directory of a Hugo site.

In *<hugo-base>*, add this repo as a Git submodule:

``` bash
$ git submodule add https://github.com/okomestudio/hugo-theme-okome <hugo-base>/themes/hugo-theme-okome
```

Then, open *<hugo-base>/config.toml* and ensure the theme option is set to
`hugo-theme-okome`:

``` toml
theme = "hugo-theme-okome"
```
